# What is a Pull Request?

Other resources have this well covered, so I'll [let them explain](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)!

For our purposes, we're going to think of it as a way to sync changes we made to a branch with another branch! Or, as a collaboration tool! 

# How do we do a pull request!? :thinking:

  1. Firsts things first, you'll want to [fork this repository](https://github.com/chris-alexiuk/GitGood-Forking) and then [clone it](https://github.com/chris-alexiuk/GitGood-Cloning)!
  2. Next up, you'll want to: 
  
      a. [Make a new branch](https://github.com/chris-alexiuk/GitGood-Branches)
      
      b. Edit this README.md to include your name
      
      c. [Add, and commit](https://youtu.be/2HztaI1PPOk) the modification
      
      d. [Push that edit](https://github.com/chris-alexiuk/GitGood-GitPush) to your remote!
  3. Now that you've got that change on your remote repository, you should see a new banner!

  4. You'll want to go ahead and create that pull request!
  
  5. Now you should see a window similar to this, where you can add a description and a commit message!

  6. After that, there are a number of interesting things you can do - and you can check those out in the video, or through the documentation!
  
**You're all done!** :tada:

## Your name here:
